          <p>I recently graduated from the University of the Philippines Manila with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am a womenâ€™s rights advocate and very passionate about learning new technologies to help the underserved.</p>
          <p>My special problem is about Breast Cancer Detection in Two-View Film Mammography using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It aims to help identify tumor as benign or malignant on screening mammograms. Three popular CNN architectures - VGG 16, ResNet 50, and DenseNet 121 were used for the classification task. </p>
